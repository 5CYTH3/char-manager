# Charcoal (DnD Character Manager)
Charcoal is a desktop app written using Tauri and SvelteKit, for managing efficiently and securely your DnD 5e edition characters (soon 2024 edition).
It is based on ressources like [aidedd](https://www.aidedd.org/) and is supposed to set a new standard in terms of characters data format (JSON-based, but maybe TOML based in the future).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is for now in a prototype state. Basic visuals have been made using Figma, there is minimal JSON CRUD operations for characters.
> Link to the [figma project](https://www.figma.com/design/Lg6SMWXGeaqfFrUfOFMHgN/char-manager?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=pZM2ZPj66zXb07oF-1)

## Todo list
- [ ] Finish characters page
- [ ] Finish the character interface
- [ ] Implement lock-based data modification on each data cells.
- [ ] Add spells API support for quickly looking up spells. Will be using [this DnD 5e API](https://5e-bits.github.io/docs/tutorials).
- [ ] Add ThreeJS dice roll animations for dice rolling.

# Missing Content / Issues
Please create an issue on this repo to report any missing content, desired behaviour of the interface, or bugs encountered. This is very important as I alone don't know many aspects of the game and hope to cover as much as possible of these unknown aspects through your issues.
